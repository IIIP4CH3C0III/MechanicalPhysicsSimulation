# MechanicalPhysicsSimulation

<p>
  This project has the goal of applying and combining the knowledge acquired in mechanical physics and programing classes
</p>

<p>
  Physics objectives:
  <ul>
    <li>Be able to have simulations in two dimensions;</li>
    <li>Be able to apply forces and see the results in a graph and stats;</li>
    <li>Be able to reduce time to more precise values;</li>
    <li>Be able to change the world proprieties;</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Programing objectives:
  <ul>
    <li>Write the all code in C;</li>
    <li>Be really lightweight and fast;</li>
    <li>If it's possible run directly in the terminal;</li>
  </ul>

</p>
