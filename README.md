## Introduction
This project has the goal of applying and combining the knowledge acquired in mechanical physics and programing classes

<p>
  Physics objectives:
  <ul>
    <li>Be able to have simulations in two dimensions;</li>
    <li>Be able to apply forces and see the results in a graph and stats;</li>
    <li>Be able to reduce time to more precise values;</li>
    <li>Be able to change the world proprieties;</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Programing objectives:
  <ul>
    <li>Write the all code in C;</li>
    <li>Be really lightweight and fast;</li>
    <li>If it's possible run directly in the terminal;</li>
  </ul>
</p>

## Installation

After cloning the project or downloading the ZIP file and extract it, you simply have run the file called simulation.

## Usage

To start the simulation three things must be configured, the object itself, the world proprietaries and the graph step.
With that done you are ready to start seeing the results.
